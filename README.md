# note-taker
For this app I created a place for users to take notes. <br>
This app is deployed on Heroku. <br>
This app runs on terminal and asks for the user to login with their heroku credentials. <br>
Then the user is brought to create-a-note section where this app is deployed at. <br>
The user is can then open app on the top right corner of the screen and a note taker screen should appear. <br>
There is a button where the user can press to start to take their notes. <br>
The user is then presented with a list of previously written notes and also a place where they can create a new note. <br>
The user can give the new note a title and its desired content and then can hit save at the top right. <br> The currently made note is then displayed in the side bar with the other previously written notes. <br> 
The user can also delete the notes with the trash can icon next to the note. <br> 
The user can also refresh the page to start over again. <br>
